# OpenMapSamples-MapLibre

OpenMapSamples is a library to generate and provide sample data for testing vector-based map renderings. Sample data is returned as GeoJSON and can be rendered by mapping systems and styles to validate their coverage of combinations of data.

The OpenMapSamples-MapLibre package provides a MapLibre control and integration
that allows OpenMapSamples to be rendered in MapLibre.
